`Replica` Is a Slack app that integrates with Datadog, allowing users to seamlessly create replicas of dashboards directly from Slack.

</div>

## Overview

The app provides several functionalities, including:

1. **Event Handling**: Utilizing Slack's Events API and Socket Mode, the app listens for specific Slack events.
2. **Dashboard Replication**: It fetches available Datadog dashboards and presents a dropdown list to the user. After a dashboard selection, it creates a replica in Datadog.
3. **Name Generation**: Generates a fun, randomized name for the replica dashboard.
4. **Environment Configuration**: The app sources its configuration from an `.env` file.

## Key Features

- **Slack Interactivity**:
  - Replies with a greeting to "hello" messages.
  - Opens a dashboard selection modal on the 'replica' shortcut command.
  - Posts messages with links to the replicated dashboard and a merge option.

- **Datadog Integration**:
  - Retrieves available dashboards from Datadog.
  - Facilitates dashboard replication.
